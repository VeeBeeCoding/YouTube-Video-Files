-- NOTE: If you haven't already, run scripts from "[SQL] Trigger to track Update, Insert, Delete" scripts in GitHub to have tables and trigger created before you run the below scripts


-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-- First: Insert
Insert into Buckets (Category, Subcategory, Comment, Amount, Due_Date, Modified_By, Timestamp) 
Values ('Other Expenses','Bird seed','Refill for winter',1000.43,'1st','VB_Insert',GETDATE())

-- Second: Update
Update Buckets 
Set Comment = 'Buy 6 bags', Amount = 1300, Modified_By = 'JDOE', Timestamp = Getdate() 
where Subcategory = 'Bird seed' 

-- Third: Delete
Delete from Buckets 
where Subcategory = 'Bird seed' 

-- Review Audit table to see how they look
Select * from Buckets_ADT

-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-- Step 1: Write a select that will be used in "From" section of main unpivoted Select (for Old values)

-- [OLD Values] 
Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, old_modified_by, sys_user, 
OLD_CATEGORY, 
OLD_SUBCATEGORY, 
OLD_COMMENT, 
OLD_AMOUNT, 
OLD_DUE_DATE, 
OLD_TIMESTAMP
from buckets_adt 

-- Step 2: Now we take the above Select, and unpivot some of the columns 
-- The main idea is that in the end, all OLD values are in one column, all NEW values are in one column

Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, OLD_MODIFIED_BY, SYS_USER, 
unpv.OldCol, 
unpv.Oldvalue
from (
			Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, old_modified_by, sys_user, 
			OLD_CATEGORY, 
			OLD_SUBCATEGORY, 
			OLD_COMMENT, 
			OLD_AMOUNT, 
			OLD_DUE_DATE, 
			OLD_TIMESTAMP
			from buckets_adt 
			) as S1
unpivot
(Oldvalue for OldCol in (
						OLD_CATEGORY, 
						OLD_SUBCATEGORY, 
						OLD_COMMENT, 
						OLD_AMOUNT, 
						OLD_DUE_DATE, 
						OLD_TIMESTAMP
						)
) as unpv


-- Step 3: Unpivot 
-- So let's make it treat all old values as the same data type. 
-- When using Cast, will need to be sure to add a column name, or else will get an error 

-- [[ Completed Old Values select ]] 
Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, OLD_MODIFIED_BY, SYS_USER, 
unpv.OldCol, 
Right(unpv.OldCol,Len(unpv.OldCol)-4) as 'Col Description',
unpv.Oldvalue
from (
			Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, old_modified_by, sys_user, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_CATEGORY AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_CATEGORY, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_SUBCATEGORY AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_SUBCATEGORY, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_COMMENT AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_COMMENT, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_AMOUNT AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_AMOUNT, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_DUE_DATE AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_DUE_DATE, 
			ISNULL(CAST(OLD_TIMESTAMP AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS OLD_TIMESTAMP
			from buckets_adt 
			) as S1
unpivot
(Oldvalue for OldCol in (
						OLD_CATEGORY, 
						OLD_SUBCATEGORY, 
						OLD_COMMENT, 
						OLD_AMOUNT, 
						OLD_DUE_DATE, 
						OLD_TIMESTAMP
						)
) as unpv


-- Step 4: Now we want the same select, but for new values. 
-- Copy the last Select, paste. Now replace "Old" with "New"
	-- and change select alias from S1 to S2 

-- [[ Completed New values select ]] 
Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, NEW_MODIFIED_BY, SYS_USER, 
unpv.NewCol, 
Right(unpv.NewCol,Len(unpv.NewCol)-4) as 'Col Description',
unpv.Newvalue
from (
			Select ID, action_cd, sys_date, NEW_modified_by, sys_user, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_CATEGORY AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_CATEGORY, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_SUBCATEGORY AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_SUBCATEGORY, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_COMMENT AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_COMMENT, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_AMOUNT AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_AMOUNT, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_DUE_DATE AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_DUE_DATE, 
			ISNULL(CAST(NEW_TIMESTAMP AS VARCHAR(1000)),' ') AS NEW_TIMESTAMP
			from buckets_adt 
			) as S2
unpivot
(Newvalue for NewCol in (
						NEW_CATEGORY, 
						NEW_SUBCATEGORY, 
						NEW_COMMENT, 
						NEW_AMOUNT, 
						NEW_DUE_DATE, 
						NEW_TIMESTAMP
						)
) as unpv
